Subject: *URGENT* Can you make this script better?

Hey,

We've been really impressed how you cleaned up some of our old
accounting scripts.  I found this old one in our github and was
wondering if you had any ideas on how to improve it.

Right now, it only tracks a melon's name, if it has seeds and 
its price.  We'll want to add the ability to keep track of
the flesh color, rind color and average weight.

Our sales team also loves to give us additional requirements at
the last minute, but i'm afraid in its current state that's going 
to be a real pain to manage.

I'm attaching two files, "melon_info.py" is the main script and
"melons.py" contains the melon data.

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead
